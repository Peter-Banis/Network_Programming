This file will explain the format of our PEERS file. The format is similar to the format used in the GOSSIP file. All peers will be stored with the following form:

BEGIN
1:Name
2:Port number
3:IP address
END

an example file would be

BEGIN
1:John
2:2356
3:163.118.239.68
END
BEGIN
1:Mary
2:2355
3:163.118.237.60
END

and so on. The reasoning for the format is the same as the reasoning for the GOSSIP file format.
